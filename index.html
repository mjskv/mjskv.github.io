        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>My name is Marta. Since as long as I can remember, my family and I have always been travelling.
           My parents enabled me to see the world in all of it's beauty and diversity, for which I am very thankful.
           I am incredibly happy and lucky that at the age of 20 I have visited 45 countries. Travel plays a very important role in my life.
        </p>

          Traveling requires a lot of effort, money and time. However, the opportunity to get to know different cultures,
          enjoy nature, explore history and art, and most importantly - to acquire new knowledge and skills makes it worth anything in the world.
          Travelling makes me happy and inspires me to become a better person and strive for higher heights in life. </p>
