        <h1>Trip to Bali</h1>

        <p>Indonesia is the best place I ever visited.</p>
        <p>What I loved the most is how colourful the island of Bali is. Bali mesmerized me by it's stunning natural beauty,
          including the white sand beaches, the emerald rice terrace as well as all of the mountains and waterfalls.
          These natural marvels of nature create a unique and picturesque landscape.</p>

          <p>Anywhere I would look I would see smiling people and the most jawdropping peisages I had ever seen in my life.
          In Bali, I would mostly walk about and familiarize myself with the island.
          However, I also had the opportunity to visit temples.
          There are many different things to do in Bali such as surfing, diving, yoga and meditation.</p>

          <p>After my stay in Bali came to an end I brought home many beautiful accessories, photos and unforgettable memories.</p>

        <h1>Trip to Brno</h1>
        <img src="images/brno1.jpeg" alt="church in Brno" width=281 height=420>
        <p>
          The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and special in its own way.
          Unfortunately for us, we did not enjoy it at all.
          The city of Brno didn't leave the best impression for us.
        </p>
            <img src="images/brno3.jpeg" alt="Brno alley" width=281 height=420>

        <p>During our visit to the Czech Republic, the weather in Brno wasn't very kind to us. The city was gray for our entire stay in the Czech Republic.
          Everything seemed monochrome, old fashioned with absolutely no attraction to any of the landmarks or buildings. </p>

          <img src="images/brno2.jpeg" alt="Brno tower" width=281 height=420>

          <p>To me it felt like I was transported back into the USSR, most likely because I was merely passing through
            and didn't have the chance to visit any beautiful places.
            I would love to come back in the future and change my opinion, however.</p>
